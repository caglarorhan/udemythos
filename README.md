A basic browser extension try to add some features to Udemy student video course pages.
 I'd like to thank Ömer Büyükçelik [https://github.com/bykclk] for the idea about to modify Udemy video players play rates. His reply twt to mine is
 ``document.querySelector("video").playbackRate = 4``
 
 So let us try to create a browser extension.
 
 **Tested and passed in:**
 - Opera Version:58.0.3135.132
 - Chrome Version 74.0.3729.131 (Official Build) (64-bit)
